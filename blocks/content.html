Dear {{FNAME}},
</h3>

<p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
I hope this email finds you well.
</p>

<p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
I am writing on behalf of GDG on Campus MIET to request your support through sponsorship for Maadhyam 2k26, our flagship technical and community-driven event focused on emerging technologies, knowledge exchange, and meaningful industry interaction.
</p>

<p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
Maadhyam 2k26 is a curated series of technical speaker sessions and discussions designed to bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world industry practices. The event brings together a focused audience of students, developers, and early-career professionals who are actively building skills and exploring opportunities in the technology ecosystem.
</p>

<p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
This edition of Maadhyam is being conducted in collaboration with CodeCap (Community) and is presented by Genesis, strengthening its reach, credibility, and overall impact.
</p>

<p style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6;">
Support from organizations like yours plays a vital role in enabling initiatives such as Maadhyam. Your sponsorship would directly contribute to creating an accessible, high-quality platform for learning, collaboration, and community growth, while also offering your organization meaningful visibility and engagement with a tech-focused audience.
</p>

<p style="font-size:14px; font-weight:bold;">
As a sponsoring partner, your organization would receive:
</p>

<ul style="font-size:14px; line-height:1.6; padding-left:18px;">
  <li>Brand visibility across event promotions, digital platforms, and on-ground collaterals</li>
  <li>Recognition among a large and engaged developer and student community</li>
  <li>Opportunities to interact with participants, speakers, and community members</li>
  <li>Association with a knowledge-driven, community-first initiative</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size:14px;">
To help you better understand the event and sponsorship structure, we have attached the event brochure, which includes details about the event concept, audience reach, sponsorship tiers, and associated benefits.
</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;">
We would be glad to connect for a brief discussion to explore sponsorship possibilities and understand how we can align this collaboration with your organization’s objectives.
</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;">
Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward to the possibility of partnering with you for Maadhyam 2k26.
</p>
