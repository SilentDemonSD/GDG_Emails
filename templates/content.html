    Dear {{FNAME}},
</h3>

<p style="margin:0 0 12px;">
    I hope this email finds you well.
</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 12px;">
    I am writing on behalf of <strong>GDG on Campus MIET</strong> to request
    your support through sponsorship for <strong>Maadhyam 2k26</strong>,
    our flagship technical and community-driven event focused on emerging
    technologies, knowledge exchange, and meaningful industry interaction.
</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 12px;">
    Maadhyam 2k26 is a curated series of technical speaker sessions and
    discussions designed to bridge the gap between academic learning and
    real-world industry practices.
</p>

<p style="margin:20px 0 8px; font-weight:600;">
    As a sponsoring partner, your organization would receive:
</p>

<ul style="margin:0 0 12px 18px; padding:0;">
    <li>Brand visibility across event promotions and on-ground collaterals</li>
    <li>Recognition within a large developer and student community</li>
    <li>Direct interaction with participants, speakers, and organizers</li>
    <li>Association with a knowledge-driven, community-first initiative</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin:0 0 12px;">
    We would be glad to connect for a brief discussion to explore sponsorship
    possibilities and alignment with your organization’s objectives.
</p>

<p style="margin:24px 0 0;">
    Warm regards,<br>
    <strong>Team GDG on Campus MIET</strong>
